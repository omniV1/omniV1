## 🚀 About Me

🛩️ **From Aerospace Technician to Aspiring Software Engineer**

My professional journey began on the flightline, maintaining and troubleshooting F-22 Raptors for the United States Air Force at Tyndall AFB (95th AMU) and Edwards AFB (411th CTF). Working with cutting-edge aviation technology taught me the value of precision, discipline, and teamwork under pressure.

Now, I’m channeling those same values into software development at Grand Canyon University. Whether it’s debugging code or collaborating on a group project, I bring a commitment to excellence and adaptability honed from years in aerospace.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Skills

I thrive on building software that’s both functional and elegant, drawing on a diverse toolkit:

- **C# & .NET:** Desktop applications, web platforms, and collaborative projects
- **Java & Spring Boot:** Enterprise-grade microservices and backend systems
- **TypeScript & JavaScript:** Modern web development for responsive, user-friendly interfaces
- **HTML & CSS:** Frontend design, rapid prototyping, and creative UI work
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Data analysis, visualization, and experimentation
- **Shell scripting & Perl:** Automation, utility scripts, and process optimization

> **Learning Never Stops:** I’m always exploring new technologies, frameworks, and techniques—because growth is a journey, not a destination.

## ✈️ From Raptors to Repos

My transition from maintaining fighter jets to architecting code has been both challenging and rewarding. The discipline, attention to detail, and collaborative mindset I gained in aerospace have become the foundation of my approach to software development.

Whether I’m refactoring legacy code or engineering new solutions, I believe in clear communication, mutual support, and always striving for improvement.
